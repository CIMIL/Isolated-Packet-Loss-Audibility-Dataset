# Isolated-Packet-Loss-Audibility-Dataset
This repository contains a labeled dataset for isolated packet losses in musical audio.

This is a landing page. To reach the dataset, chose the branch of interest:

- [phd-thesis](https://github.com/CIMIL/Isolated-Packet-Loss-Audibility-Dataset/tree/phd-thesis): contains the results presented in Luca Vignati's PhD thesis called "Real-Time and High Quality Musical Audio Streaming Over IP".
- [jaes](https://github.com/CIMIL/Isolated-Packet-Loss-Audibility-Dataset/tree/jaes): contains the results presented in the the paper called "On the lack of a perceptually-motivated evaluation metric for Packet Loss Concealment in Networked Music Performances" by Luca Vignati and Luca Turchet, submitted to the Journal of the Audio Engineering Society.
